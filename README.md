# ISBE Midyear Reporting Scripts

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
In Illinois, at the at the end of every semester, each school is required to submit a set of data to the Office of I&I for transmission to the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE). The state then uses this data to produce the annual State School Report Cards. The purpose of this project is to collect student and teacher data from KIPP Chicago's different data systems and put them in a format that conforms to ISBE's reporting standards. Note, no data is included in this repository.
